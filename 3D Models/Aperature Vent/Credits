### Credits for the Vent Mechanism

The iris-style vent aperture used in this project is based on the excellent 3D model:

This is a remix of the original "Servo automated iris / aperture for air flow controll" by **AcE Krystal** (https://www.printables.com/model/5122-servo-automated-iris-aperture-for-air-flow-control).

Thank you to both creators for sharing this clever servo-driven iris design — it works perfectly as an automated enclosure vent!
