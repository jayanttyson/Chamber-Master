How to Tune Your Continuous Rotation ServoUpload the sketch above.
Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud, line ending: Newline).
First goal: Find true STOP pulseSend +10 and -10 slowly around 1500
Watch/listen until the servo completely stops moving
Note that exact value (e.g., 1492 µs) → this becomes SERVO_STOP_PULSE

Determine directions:From stop value, send +20 → see which way it turns
Send -20 → opposite direction
Decide which direction opens the vent → that’s SERVO_REVERSE_PULSE
Opposite → SERVO_FORWARD_PULSE (closing)

Time-based movement:Set a moderate speed pulse (e.g., 1600)
Use time 2000 → runs for 2 seconds then stops
Measure how far the vent moves
Repeat with different times to find:Time needed for full open
Time for half open
Time for full close

Update your main Chamber-Master code with your measured values.

This method works perfectly for continuous rotation servos where angle control doesn't apply — everything is time-based! 

you can try dephault values in the code already if that work for you
