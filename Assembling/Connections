Here is a clear, text-only list of all connections for easy reference when building the project.
ESP32 to Components
Chamber Temperature Sensor (DS18B20)
Data pin → GPIO 32
VCC → 5V
GND → GND
(4.7kΩ pull-up resistor between Data and 5V recommended)

Intake Temperature Sensor (DS18B20)
Data pin → GPIO 13
VCC → 5V
GND → GND
(Same 4.7kΩ pull-up can be shared with chamber sensor)

Ambient Sensor (DHT11 or DHT22)
Data pin → GPIO 23
VCC → 5V
GND → GND
(10kΩ pull-up on data pin recommended for DHT11)

Rotary Encoder (KY-040 or similar)
CLK → GPIO 25
DT  → GPIO 26
SW  → GPIO 27 (internal pull-up used in code)
VCC → 5V or 3.3V (depending on module)
GND → GND

SG90 Servo (for vent)
Signal (Orange/Yellow) → GPIO 5
VCC (Red) → 5V
GND (Brown/Black) → GND

120mm PC Fan
PWM control (Blue) → GPIO 33
Tachometer/RPM (Yellow) → GPIO 19
+12V (Red) → +12V from power supply
GND (Black) → Collector of 2N2222 transistor (see below)

Fan Hard-Kill Circuit (True 0 RPM)
GPIO 15 → 1kΩ resistor → Base of 2N2222 transistor
Emitter of 2N2222 → GND
Collector of 2N2222 → Fan GND wire (Black)
(This cuts power completely when fan is off)

SSD1306 OLED Display (128×64, I2C)
SDA → GPIO 21 (default I2C SDA on most ESP32 boards)
SCL → GPIO 22 (default I2C SCL)
VCC → 3.3V or 5V (check your module)
GND → GND

Status LED
Built-in LED on GPIO 2 (indicates active cooling) – no external wiring needed

Power Notes
Use a stable 5V supply for ESP32, sensors, servo, and OLED.
Fan typically requires 12V – connect directly from printer PSU or separate 12V supply.
All GND pins must be connected together (common ground).
4.7kOhms resister on temp Sensors not need if using a module , they are inbuilt

This list matches the default pinout in the code.
You can change any GPIO in the sketch if needed.
