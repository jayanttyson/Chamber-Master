### Hardware Requirements for Chamber-Master

Here is the complete list of hardware needed to build the project:

- **ESP32 development board** – 1  
  Any standard board (e.g., ESP32-WROOM-32, DevKitC)

- **SSD1306 128×64 OLED display** – 1  
  I2C interface, address 0x3C (most common modules)

- **DS18B20 temperature sensor** – 2  
  Waterproof versions strongly recommended (one for chamber, one for intake)

- **Pull-up resistor (4.7kΩ)** – 1  
  For DS18B20 OneWire bus (can be shared between both sensors)

- **DHT11 or DHT22 sensor** – 1  
  For ambient temperature & humidity (DHT22 is more accurate)

- **Pull-up resistor (10kΩ)** – 1  
  Recommended for DHT11/22 data pin

- **Rotary encoder with push button** – 1  
  Standard KY-040 module or equivalent

- **SG90 micro servo** – 1  
  Standard rotation (not continuous) – for driving the vent mechanism

- **120mm 4-pin PC fan** – 1  
  Must have PWM control (blue wire) and tachometer output (yellow wire)

- **2N2222 NPN transistor** – 1  
  For hard-kill low-side switch on fan ground

- **1kΩ resistor** – 1  
  Base resistor for the 2N2222 transistor

- **Jumper wires / Dupont cables** – Many  
  For prototyping and connections

- **Breadboard or PCB** – 1  
  For prototyping; perfboard or custom PCB for permanent build

- **Power supply**  
  5V (at least 2A) for ESP32, servo, sensors, OLED  
  12V for fan (can use printer PSU or separate supply)

**Optional but Recommended**
- 2.2KOhms resister for DS18B20 Temp sensor for signal filtering at VCC and DATA
- 3D-printed iris vent mechanism  
  (based on: https://www.printables.com/model/533875-servo-automated-iris-aperture-for-120-mm-fan)
- Enclosure or mounting bracket for clean installation

This list covers everything required to fully replicate the Chamber-Master controller. Happy building! 🛠️
