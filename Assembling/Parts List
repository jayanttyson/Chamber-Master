### Basic Parts List for Chamber-Master

Here is a simple, beginner-friendly shopping list with only the essential components needed to build the project.

- **ESP32 development board** × 1  
  (e.g., ESP32 DevKitC or any ESP32-WROOM module)

- **SSD1306 128×64 OLED display (I2C)** × 1

- **DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor** × 2  
  (One for inside the enclosure, one for intake air)

- **4.7kΩ resistor** × 1  
  (Pull-up for DS18B20 sensors)

- **DHT11 or DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor** × 1  
  (DHT22 recommended for better accuracy)

- **10kΩ resistor** × 1  
  (Pull-up for DHT sensor – often already on the module)

- **Rotary encoder module with button** × 1  
  (KY-040 or similar)

- **SG90 micro servo** × 1

- **120mm 4-pin PC fan** × 1  
  (Must have PWM and tachometer wires)

- **2N2222 transistor (or any small NPN like BC547)** × 1

- **1kΩ resistor** × 1  
  (For transistor base)

- **Jumper wires (male-female & male-male)** – assorted pack

- **Breadboard (or perfboard for permanent build)** × 1

- **Power supply**  
  – 5V USB or 5V/2A+ adapter (for ESP32, servo, sensors)  
  – 12V source for fan (optional – can use printer's PSU)

**Optional (but highly recommended)**
- 3D-printed iris vent mechanism

This is the minimal set to get a fully working Chamber-Master controller. Start with a breadboard setup, then move to a permanent soldered version once tested!
